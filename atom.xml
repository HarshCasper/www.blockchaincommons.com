&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do?&lt;/em&gt; We’ve just released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY&quot;&gt;a Technology Overview video&lt;/a&gt; that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s&quot;&gt;entropy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s&quot;&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s&quot;&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s&quot;&gt;airgaps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s&quot;&gt;multisigs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s&quot;&gt;secure storage&lt;/a&gt; to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s&quot;&gt;CBOR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s&quot;&gt;CRC-32&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s&quot;&gt;Fountain Codes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s&quot;&gt;QRs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s&quot;&gt;SHA-256&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s&quot;&gt;Shamir’s Secret Sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
&lt;img width=&quot;30%&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/video-news-2.png&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s&quot;&gt;Bytewords&lt;/a&gt; are a text-encoding method for binary data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s&quot;&gt;Uniform Resources&lt;/a&gt; support self-describing data that can be used interoperably.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s&quot;&gt;LifeHash&lt;/a&gt; allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s&quot;&gt;SSKR&lt;/a&gt; provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s&quot;&gt;Torgap&lt;/a&gt; architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY&quot;&gt;Technology Overview video&lt;/a&gt; discusses all of this and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md&quot;&gt;Uniform Resources: An Overview&lt;/a&gt; explains how URs are put together, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md&quot;&gt;A Guide to Using URs for Key Material&lt;/a&gt; looks at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ur:crypto-seed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ur:crypto-bip39&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ur:crypto-hdkey&lt;/code&gt; as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions&quot;&gt;Airgapped Wallet Community&lt;/a&gt; to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; to see how some of our technologies can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons&quot;&gt;sponsor at GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or by making a one-time donation &lt;a href=&quot;https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/&quot;&gt;at our BTCPay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;picture&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;nil}]}</name></author><category term="Introduction" /><category term="Video" /><category term="Overview" /><summary type="html">In the last year, Blockchain Commons has produced a large collection of specifications, reference libraries, architectures, and reference utilities meant to improve blockchain infrastructure by enabling interoperability among Bitcoin wallets — and in the future, other cryptocurrency applications, such as Ethereum wallets, and other cryptography programs, such as chat systems, key management programs, and more.

&lt;p&gt;In Q1 2021, Blockchain Commons largely focused on working with companies to integrate our Gordian architecture, best practices, specifications, reference libraries, and reference applications into their wallets and services. This included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Released three Gordian reference apps for public beta testing on Apple’s TestFlight;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planned the creation of an independent Gordian Recovery app for use with third-party wallets;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;keytool-cli&lt;/code&gt; command-line interface app for new UR (Universal Resource) usages and future specifications;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refined our Lifehash specification to optimaize for black &amp;amp; white usage;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tested new improvements to Lethekit;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supported the adoption of Gordian best practices by a variety of manufacturers; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked directly with our sustaining sponsor &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitmark.com/&quot;&gt;Bitmark&lt;/a&gt; to architect their new Autonomy bitcoin app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also did work to support the wider community, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Produced a major design document on multisigs;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supported DID’s advancement on its standards track;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked to develop the did:onion DID method;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developed packages to support activists; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testified to legislatures in Nevada, North Dakota, and Wyoming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/2020-Q4-Report/&quot;&gt;Also see our previous, Q4 2020 report&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bold--excerpt--node&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gordian-work&quot;&gt;Gordian Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our advances on Gordian were linked to a large-scale transition in the meaning of the Gordian system. Prior to 2021, we were offering a variety of applications, but we were simultaneously working with companies to create specifications. This created a real tension. Now that we’ve seen the beginnings of adoption of our best practices, we’ve been able to change the focus of our applications from being consumer-focused to being exemplars for other companies to study. In Q2, we expect this to mature into a &lt;strong&gt;Gordian Seal™&lt;/strong&gt; program that denotes companies who are producing products that follow the Gordian principles and our best practices. Like similar projects such as the FIDO Alliance, we expect the Gordian Seal to make it easier for everyone in the blockchain ecosystem to work together, creating  bizdev and interoperability opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordian Testing.&lt;/strong&gt; Blockchain Commons now has three iOS reference apps available for public beta testing via Apple’s Testflight: &lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/sJTaoUsM&quot;&gt;Gordian Cosigner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h&quot;&gt;Gordian Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8&quot;&gt;Guardian Wallet&lt;/a&gt;. Wallet was our original app, recently updated to support the newest Lifehash and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypto-request&lt;/code&gt; features; Cosigner is the companion signing app that we introduced last quarter; and Guardian is our newest release, a key-storage tool for iOS. As reference apps, these projects are mainly meant as exemplars, demonstrating the best practices and principles suggested by the Gordian architecture as well as exemplifying how multiple apps can interact through Airgaps and Universal Resources (URs). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TosqR8a2OXg&quot;&gt;our video&lt;/a&gt; for a real-life example of Gordian Cosigner, Guardian, and Wallet working together to securely create a multisig account and sign a PSBT, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates AirGap signing between LetheKit and Gordian Cosigner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Recovery.&lt;/strong&gt; We are already working to split a new app, “Gordian Recovery”, off of Gordian Guardian. One of our best practices for the Gordian system demands that a user can recover funds from a Gordian-approved wallet even if the company producing it disappears. Gordian Recovery will provide one way to do so, allowing a user to independently use the app to recover and sweep funds held in a multisig wallet, no matter the status of the wallet manufacturer. At its debut, we expect Gordian Recovery to support at least three different companies with their own multisig hardware or software wallet systems. Generally, Guardian Recovery, like Gordian Cosigner, demonstrates how Blockchain Commons will interact with the wallet ecosystem by providing not just specifications, best practices, and references, but also complementary apps that can support third-party wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keytool Updates.&lt;/strong&gt; Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/keytool-cli&quot;&gt;keytool CLI (command-line interface) app&lt;/a&gt; also received major upgrades in Q1. We expanded it to support the new UR (Universal Resource) &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypto-request&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypto-response&lt;/code&gt; features that add support for arbitrary requests. This is a first step in moving away from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m/48'&lt;/code&gt; derivation used by current hardware wallets for multisig, which often results in master or cosigner xpub reuse and thus a risk to privacy. This means that we now have the infrastructure to demonstrate different solutions to the problems of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m/48'&lt;/code&gt;xpub reuse, but there’s still a lot of legacy use cases that need to be resolved. (We also reviewed one solution for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;m/48'&lt;/code&gt; derivation problem and found it unnecessarily complex, so: onward.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifehash Improvements.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the Gordian specifications that we’ve created while working with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions&quot;&gt;Airgapped Wallet Community&lt;/a&gt; focus on interoperability, particularly moving data across airgaps. Lifehash is something else: it’s a user-interface specification meant to give users trust in the continuity of cryptocurrency accounts without having to depend on reading text addresses, which aren’t user-intuitive. Instead, Lifehash creates unique, colored icons for each account that remain consistent over time. This quarter, we adjusted the colors used by Lifehash so that they look better in black &amp;amp; white printing, and simultaneously experimented with dithering on the 200x200 LetheKit display, to ensure that we could display meaningful information on a worst-case small black &amp;amp; white display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;height:1px; border:none; color:#000; background-color:#000;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash/master/images/lifehash-grayscale-v1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;height:1px; border:none; color:#000; background-color:#000;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash/master/images/lifehash-grayscale-v2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;height:1px; border:none; color:#000; background-color:#000;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lethekit Updates.&lt;/strong&gt; The DIY &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit/&quot;&gt;LetheKit&lt;/a&gt; has been our prime reference for testing hardware implementations of our Gordian best practices. Not only did we test it out with dithered Lifehashes last quarter, but we also were able to use its display to test out animated QRs for transferring PSBTs. It worked! (Albeit, slowly.) See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; of LetheKit exporting derived keys to Gordian Signer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordian Adoption.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, as noted, we’re very happy to see continued adoption of Gordian. Last quarter, we talked about all of the software and library development being done by wallet companies. This quarter, we’re seeing more companies committing to including SSKRs (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction), URs (Universal Resources), and other Gordian features in their wallets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sparrowwallet.com/&quot;&gt;Sparrow Wallet&lt;/a&gt; has been expanding its capabilities, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdevices.com/&quot;&gt;Foundation Devices&lt;/a&gt; was the newest to announce their integration of some UR features, including animated PSBTs. Foundation and Sparrow have both been working with us for a while: we’re thrilled to see both hardware and software wallet companies incorporating Blockchain Commons specifications! We’re also aware of two more software-wallet companies who haven’t made announcements yet, and we’ve been extensively working with a third company to produce a Gordian-approved wallet that entirely matches our principles and best practices and adds on some great UI besides. We can now announce that third company is Bitmark …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy Architecting.&lt;/strong&gt; Blockchain Commons has been working with Bitmark to design Autonomy, a bitcoin wallet and digital assets manager. Their goal is to make it easy for families to gain independence and preserve generational wealth. Autonomy combines a mobile app with your own dedicated full node running privately in the cloud. We used a partitioned architecture (keys across app+node) and a personal recovery network (using SSKR) to remove all single points of failure. When you transact, everything is multisig between your app and full node. Any single key can fail and you won’t lose your funds. Nothing else like this currently exists in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-advances&quot;&gt;Other Advances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some details on our other major projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multisig Documents.&lt;/strong&gt; This quarter, we released our first major expansion to our #SmartCustody tutorials since 2019: a 10,000-word document on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md&quot;&gt;Designing Multisig for Independence &amp;amp; Resilience&lt;/a&gt;. The state of multisig wasn’t sufficiently advanced to provide specific advice when we originally wrote #SmartCustody, so we’re now happy to include it by breaking down the design of multisig addresses into theoretical, transactional, operational, and functional elements and providing design patterns and examples to help you put those elements together. Want to know why Blockchain Commons is today focused on multisig technology and how to create them to meet your own needs? It’s all here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DID Recommendation.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve been working with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/&quot;&gt;DID specification&lt;/a&gt; since it was incubated at early &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weboftrust.info/&quot;&gt;Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust workshops&lt;/a&gt;, and co-authored by Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen. We’re thrilled that it’s now a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/&quot;&gt;Candidate Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;. There might still be revisions and new candidates, but this is the beginning of the last stage in creating an official internet standard for decentralized identity on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DID Method Expansion.&lt;/strong&gt; Meanwhile, Blockchain Commons is doing its own work on DIDs, with a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion&quot;&gt;did:onion method implementation&lt;/a&gt;. We’re happy to say that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spruceid.com/&quot;&gt;Spruce Systems&lt;/a&gt; is already considering it for their DID resolver. We’re also considering returning to work on our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/&quot;&gt;BTCR DID method&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of the first DID methods, but has gotten somewhat out of date with recent updates to Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apt Packages.&lt;/strong&gt; We have produced apt packages for installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli&quot;&gt;seedtool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/keytool-cli&quot;&gt;keytool&lt;/a&gt; for use with Debian and Tails OSes. This is a first step in providing support tools for human-rights activists, which we expect to get more emphasis in our work in Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legislative Work.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, Christopher Allen’s work with legislatures multiplied last quarter. In Wyoming, he led efforts that resulted in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039&quot;&gt;Wyoming Digital Identity Act&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a specific definition of digital identity that works toward the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html&quot;&gt;principles of self-sovereign identity&lt;/a&gt;. Work on a private-key-protection bill was less successful, as it had to be withdrawn after being spoiled by an amendment. Christopher has also recently testified before legislatures in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/testimony/HIBL-3024-20210208-5787-F-ALLEN_CHRISTOPHER.pdf&quot;&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; and Nevada. This is all crucial work because actual engineering will ultimately be limited and directed by what states legislate, so we want to make sure the laws fit the technology and the needs of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intern Search.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re thrilled that our Summer 2021 internship program has been sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1366880813845909506&quot;&gt;Humans Rights Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve thus put out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32&quot;&gt;a call for interns&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re expanding our usual development work to also include direct support for activists, who need help to maintain their privacy in potentially hostile regimes. However, to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we’re also considering working with interns to do research and conduct interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf&quot;&gt;Amira model&lt;/a&gt; from RWOT. If you are interested in having developers work with or mentor blockchain interns, want to suggest intern projects, or even have engineers who might be interested in working on Blockchain Commons projects briefly during the summer, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com&quot;&gt;please mail us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taproot &amp;amp; Schnorr First Steps.&lt;/strong&gt; We may see a major upgrade for Bitcoin as soon as this fall, if &lt;em&gt;Speedy Trial&lt;/em&gt; is approved for Taproot and Schnorr. The first will increase privacy for #SmartCustody features such as timelocks and multisig, while the second will allow aggregated multisig, which offer several advantages over traditional ECDSA signatures. Our brand-new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli&quot;&gt;musign CLI&lt;/a&gt; app provides the first experimental support for Schnorr signatures leveraging the Taproot/Schnorr BIPS, but independent from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bitcoind&lt;/code&gt;. More to come as we ramp up to this expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;supporting-the-future&quot;&gt;Supporting the Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve laid out our initial roadmap for the next two cycles of Blockchain Commons efforts, covering spring and summer. Important topics includes finalizing our Gordian Seal program, solving problems with xpub reuse in Bitcon multisig, supporting and advancing SSKR (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) for not just cryptographic seeds but other data, continuing to support and advance URs (Universal Resources) with encrypted and/or signed CBOR, and architecting a new QuickConnect 2.0 for initiating TorGap-based services between peers. If you’d like to know more about our roadmap, especially if you considering becoming a sustaining sponsor or to sponsor a specific project on our roadmap, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com&quot;&gt;contact us directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit more information on everything:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bold--excerpt--node&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordian Cosigner Releases.&lt;/strong&gt; We have released alpha versions of the entire Gordian Cosigner family of apps, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS&quot;&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt;. These applications support the signing of multisig transactions in an airgapped manner, creating a new level of support for what we see as the future of Bitcoin transactions. Though the iOS and MacOS apps were created in-house, the Android app was developed by Bitmark, who is both a sustaining and contributing sponsor to Blockchain Commons. We are expecting public Testflights of the apps in January, but before we have a full public release, we need to work with the Airgapped Wallet Community on related specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet Community Expansion.&lt;/strong&gt; We are continuing the successful collaboration with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community&quot;&gt;Airgapped Wallet Community&lt;/a&gt;, which has also given us a seat at the table for discussions of wallet standardization. Our Universal Resources (UR) specification and its animated QRs are increasingly being adopted, with our UR library now available in C++, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. We’ve also been doing extensive work with Bitmark on their Autonomy wallet release, which is built on our Gordian architecture design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wallet Community Multisig Research.&lt;/strong&gt; Our early work with multisigs has shown that critical elements like the m/48’ derivation, PSBTs, and descriptors are all underspecified given modern bitcoin architecture. In addition, current multisig usage doesn’t include schemes to prevent xpub reuse or to secure internal metadata in support of cosigning. In conjuction with our wallet community, we are working on standardizing the methodology for creating account maps for multisig cosigning; investigating ways to store full wallet descriptors and metadata for multisigs without creating new privacy problems; and defining the different roles of multisig cosigners. Some multisig issues are UX-focused, and so we are also defining user interfaces that can help humans to make meaningful decisions when cosigning. This research has included a new release of our Swift-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool&quot;&gt;LifeHashTool&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to do more in Q1, to further enable Gordian Cosigner as our premiere multisig release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seedtool Expansion.&lt;/strong&gt; Our seedtool apps, which offer best-practices examples of offline seed generation, continue to expand. We’d previously released a seedtool as part of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit&quot;&gt;LetheKit&lt;/a&gt; and upgraded the separate &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli&quot;&gt;command-line version&lt;/a&gt; to beta last quarter. At this point our initial iterations of our seedtools are fully feature-complete, though we’re also planning for future versions with camera support. This quarter we also released an alpha for a third platform: an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Fehu&quot;&gt;iOS seedtool&lt;/a&gt;, currently code-named Fehu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Bitcoin 2.0 Release.&lt;/strong&gt; As planned we released &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line 2.0&lt;/a&gt; at the end of October. Our popular Bitcoin tutorial is now a complete 19-chapter course that starts with the fundamentals of Bitcoin Core usage and continues on through using Lightning and programming in seven languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torgap Architectural Focus.&lt;/strong&gt; Blockchain Commons is not just about specifications, tutorials, and applications, but also architectures. We want to prototype and exemplify the best methods for creating safe, secure, and private Bitcoin and blockchain systems. This quarter we went public with our work on Torgap, which is a new methodology to ensure separation of interests (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#what-are-the-adventages-of-the-torgap-architecture&quot;&gt;and lots of other advantages&lt;/a&gt;) by using Tor to segregate neworked services. Not only have we created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md&quot;&gt;Torgap&lt;/a&gt; repo as a nexus for the work, but we’ve also been looking at varied Torgap possibilities, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-sig-cli-rust&quot;&gt;DIDs over Torgaps&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion&quot;&gt;did:onion method&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-opentimestamps/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;open timestamps over Torgaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto Commons Reference Code.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve created a large amount of content at Blockchain Commons, and so one of our challenges is making it accessible. We did this in Q4 not just through our core Torgap repo, but also through a similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons&quot;&gt;Crypto Commons repo&lt;/a&gt;. It links up all of our crypto reference libraries (which went beta in Q3) as well as the various apps and command-line programs that exercise them, including the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords-cli&quot;&gt;bytewords-cli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architectural Review Begun.&lt;/strong&gt; Blockchain Commons also does more direct work with companies to improve the usage and trust for blockchain systems. This quarter we have begun a security architecture review of a major Decentralized IDentifier (DID) deployment that should reach one million or more people. We’ve been involved with DIDs since they were incubated at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weboftrust.info/papers.html&quot;&gt;Rebooting the Web of Trust&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re proud to do the first major review of such a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized Identity Evangelization.&lt;/strong&gt; Christopher Allen is continuing his work with the Wyoming legislature, where he is now a member of Digital Identity and DAO subcomittees. He’s been working on what will be the first laws anywhere to recognize personal digital identity (as opposed to digital data, which is the focus of many current laws). This legal definition is intended to work with legacy identity systems, but also to support future decentralization. He also has been leading another bill to give special legal protection for private keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trusted Processor Research.&lt;/strong&gt; We are always researching and analyzing the newest cryptography and blockchain innovations. This quarter that included an examination of trusted processors. We hope to advance that toward interoperable specifications for trusted hardware in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internship Planning.&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, we are planning for new intern cohorts for 2021. We have posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32&quot;&gt;complete announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Third parties have already ported the UR encoder to Python, Java, and Rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uniform Resources, or URs, are a method for encoding binary data in plain text strings that are also well-formed URIs. They are simultaneously intended to address the challenges of QR codes, which are the main way that Bitcoin wallets transmit  data across airgaps. While QR codes themselves are standard, the data encoded within QR codes is not, resulting in inconsistent usage among developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URs were created to resolve these interoperability issues by creating a standardized method for encoding binary data. They’re built on CBOR, the Concise Binary Object Representation described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049&quot;&gt;IETF RFC 7049&lt;/a&gt;. The CBOR data is encoded in a typed UR object, which creates a self-describing, structured binary representation. URs can be transmitted as text or encoded via other means, including QR codes. Once received, URs can be decoded by different apps on different machines without having to guess about the contents or the encoding methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tight size limitations of QRs, where version 40 QR codes max out at 2,953 bytes, are also resolved in the UR specification. The CBOR foundation supports sizes up to 2^32-1 bytes; the UR specification then describes how to sequence those large binary encodings into a multipart UR, which can be displayed across multiple QR codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/URDemo/master/Images/urdemo-animated.gif&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the prime use of URs has been to allow the airgapped transmission of PSBTs, which frequently don’t fit into a single QR code. Using URs, PSBTs can instead be transmitted as a animated sequence of QR codes, with each frame displaying one part of a UR sequence. Fountain codes allow the QR recording to start at any point and resolve problems with missing individual frames. This permits for the easy and intuitive transmission of partially signed transactions to airgapped devices for further signing: a user just needs to hold up a camera to scan the animated QR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, URs can do much more than that: they can support any airgapped Bitcoin function, as well as Blockchain Commons’ unique &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md&quot;&gt;torgap architecture&lt;/a&gt;. Definitions for seeds, keypaths, addresses, and accounts allow for all sorts of Bitcoin data to be transmitted in the efficient, self-describing format. In additions, URs can be sent not just as QR codes, but also as URLs or Signal Whispers. The possibilities go far beyond animated QRs for PSBTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a creator of open infrastructure, Blockchain Commons is working to support wallet interoperability, helping end-users have many flexible choices among vendors. URs are one of our earliest and most successful open wallet projects. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur&quot;&gt;bc-ur reference library&lt;/a&gt; supports URs in C++, while our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URKit&quot;&gt;URKit&lt;/a&gt; does so in Swift. The specification has also been adopted by a number of third-party wallet developers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foundation Devices, a company that focuses on open hardware for the decentralized internet, has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py&quot;&gt;python implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sparrow Wallet, a Bitcoin wallet for those who value financial self sovereignty, has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sparrowwallet/hummingbird&quot;&gt;java implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dominik Spicher has created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dspicher/ur-rs&quot;&gt;rust implementation&lt;/a&gt;.
We expect to see URs deployed in more commercial wallets in the near future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/copa-logo-small.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;
To fulfill its commitment to open source and to a defensive patent strategy, Blockchain Commons has joined COPA, the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COPA is a non-profit community that was formed by Square out of concern that misguided and offensive use of patents can stifle innovation, and that companies not focused on patent creation themselves would be unable to defend themselves from aggressive (often non-practicing) patent holders. Members of COPA pledge not to use their patents offensively and instead pool their crypto-patents to form a shared patent library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain Commons was resolute in joining COPA because it addresses problems and resolves frustrations that Commons Founder Christopher Allen has long observed with the American patent system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bold--excerpt--node&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues with crypto patents date back to the early days of the cryptography industry, when companies were unable to engage in public-key cryptography without an RSA patent license, which was expensive and difficult to obtain. RSA was a practicing owner of its patents, and it did promise FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) licenses, but these licenses were still too expensive for open-source projects. In order to support the SSL standard, as well as the TLS standard that he was then coauthoring, Allen created the RSAREF license, which sublicensed RSA’s patents in a way that met FRAND standards, and which was royalty-free for the first $50,000 — enabling open-source projects, which tended to be revenue-free. This resulted in RSAREF licensees like PGP and Red Hat being able to innovate with public-key cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen has also seen the issue of patents from the other side. When he worked at Certicom, he oversaw a large library of patents and was able to advance the idea of ethical patent usage: he convinced the executive team at Certicom to adopt an internal policy to offer FRAND licenses for the patents they were actively practicing and to use their other patents only for defensive purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even a company like Certicom was unable to avoid all of the problems with patents, particularly those caused by non-practicing patent owners. Though Allen was interested in advancing digital microcurrencies at Certicom, he was stifled by patents for Merkle trees and Schnorr signatures. Certicom’s cryptocurrency work was stalled, and new innovations in the field, such as Bitcoin, only appeared after the patents expired, the last in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the entire industry is moving toward an understanding of the problems caused by the patent system. At Blockstream, Allen was proud to see the company take a very progressive path when they made a public defensive patent pledge for their entire patent portfolio, which also ensured continuity in the case of bankruptcy. The next step would have been creating a patent pool among companies, but unfortunately Allen was stymied at the time by large companies being unwilling to join such a pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen’s commitment to an open and defensive patent policy has continued at Blockchain Commons, and so he’s delighted that Square has used its prominent position in the industry to spearhead the COPA initiative, ensuring continued innovation in the blockchain, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency fields, without the fear of frivolous patent lawsuits. This is why Blockchain Commons joined COPA as an early adopter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information on COPA is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-patent.org/&quot;&gt;open-patent.org&lt;/a&gt;; more information on Blockchain Commons is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blockchaincommons.com/&quot;&gt;blockchaincommons.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;picture&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;nil}]}</name></author><category term="Partnerships" /><category term="Philosophies" /><category term="Patents" /><category term="COPA" /><summary type="html">To fulfill its commitment to open source and to a defensive patent strategy, Blockchain Commons has joined COPA, the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance. COPA is a non-profit community that was formed by Square out of concern that misguided and offensive use of patents can stifle innovation, and that companies not focused on patent creation themselves would be unable to defend themselves from aggressive (often non-practicing) patent holders. Members of COPA pledge not to use their patents offensively and instead pool their crypto-patents to form a shared patent library. Blockchain Commons was resolute in joining COPA because it addresses problems and resolves frustrations that Commons Founder Christopher Allen has long observed with the American patent system.

Blockchain Commons has recently released v2.0 of our Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;Visit the Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons&quot;&gt;Support the Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning Bitcoin was one of our first projects, launched back in 2017 with support from Blockstream. The intent of the course was to teach the fundamentals of Bitcoin programming through &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Core&lt;/a&gt; and its RPC-based command-line interface. We chose this methodology because Bitcoin Core is one of the most robust, secure, and safe cryptocurrency interfaces in existence. We believe it’s the solid foundation for programming Bitcoin; it also allows you to interact with Bitcoin in a way that teaches the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain Commons’ overarcing goal has always been to improve the open infrastructure of the blockchain industry, and one of the ways to do that is to build the next generation of engineers. Our course was very successful in this regard. It has helped Bitcoin novices to become Bitcoin developers: some have created their own open-source projects and others have been hired for entry-level jobs. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own engineers, including many of our interns, got their start with the Learning Bitcoin course. Even GitHub’s raw numbers reveal the interest in the course, with 100 Watches, 350 Forks, and 1300 Stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Bitcoin is still undergoing rapid development, which led to the need for v2.0 of the course, to update it for the most recent releases &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.20.0&quot;&gt;Bitcoin 0.20.0&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.20.1&quot;&gt;0.20.1&lt;/a&gt;: every example in the course has been updated and revised accordingly. The updated course has also has been expanded to include a number of new topics. New sections discuss wallet descriptors, SegWit, and how SegWit’s new transaction types interact with Bitcoin Scripts. We’ve also added new chapters for larger topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A chapter on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/07_0_Expanding_Bitcoin_Transactions_PSBTs.md&quot;&gt;PSBTs&lt;/a&gt; looks at Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions as well as how they can be used with Bitcoin Core’s Hardware Interface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Though our focus is on the command-line interface, we also show how to create simple C programs to talk to Bitcoin Core using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Talking_to_Bitcoind.md&quot;&gt;RPC and ZMQ (zeromq.org) libraries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Libwally from Blockstream is a great library to use with command-line programs, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/16_0_Programming_with_Libwally.md&quot;&gt;another new Chapter&lt;/a&gt; covers leveraging its wallet and other cryptographic features.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also touch upon RPC programming in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/17_0_Talking_to_Bitcoind_Other.md&quot;&gt;Go, Java, NodeJS, Python, Rust, and Swift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, we’re proud to present our first look at using the Lightning Network from the command-line interface, focusing on Blockstream’s C-Lightning, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_0_Understanding_Your_Lightning_Setup.md&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/19_0_Using_Lightning.md&quot;&gt;chapter&lt;/a&gt; finale to the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is quickly evolving, but the Learning Bitcoin course from Blockchain Commons is now updated to teach all about its newest concepts. If you’re a novice looking to learn about programming Bitcoin, an educator needing to teach students blockchain technologies, or an expert wanting to help us by reviewing, adding to, or translating the course, please take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we need your support. Where v1 of Learning Bitcoin was largely sponsored by Blockstream, v2 was done with our own resources. We hope that you can help us recoup those costs, so that we can continue to create open infrastructure of all sorts.

Complete information for creating your own LetheKit and downloading its software can be found in Blockchain Commons’ LetheKit repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit&quot;&gt;Visit LetheKit Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons&quot;&gt;Support LetheKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you build LetheKit yourself and use open-source software, you know everything about your kit, and can depend on it for safe Bitcoin seed generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/projects/lethekit.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how easy it is to use the LetheKit to generate seeds for use in Bitcoin, LetheKit maintainer Gorazd Kovacic has recently released a short video. As it demonstrates, all you need to do is roll dice or generate hardware entropy, and the LetheKit will use that to generate truly random seeds. You can then display a Uniform Resource (UR) or a QR code, export HD keys, or convert your seed into BIP39 mnemonics or SSKR shards. The LetheKit is very versatile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you turn off LetheKit, it safely erases its memory, just like the river Lethe. You can then restore from an external source. Our suggestion is that you maintain #SmartCustody of your new keys by engraving them into stainless steel. This will ensure their resilience, and that they can’t be easily lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Ken Sedgwick for his creation of the LetheKit and to Gorazd Kovacic for his continued maintenance. The project is part of Blockchain Commons’ focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartcustody.com/index.html&quot;&gt;#SmartCustody&lt;/a&gt;, which teaches that the best way to protect cryptocurrency keys is to keep them offline: LetheKit ensures that your seeds never touch a connected device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Blockchain Commons projects such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian&quot;&gt;Gordian system&lt;/a&gt; follow this same philosophy, effortlessly dividing up your cryptocurrency between a connected node and an air-gapped mobile device. The two projects even work together. You can export keys from LetheKit and import them into your Gordian Wallet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gorazdko&quot;&gt;@gorazdko&lt;/a&gt; for the latest on LetheKit and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blockchaincomns&quot;&gt;@BlockchainComns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChristopherA&quot;&gt;@ChristopherA&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the Blockchain Commons work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quarter, in addition to the ongoing financial contributions from our Sustaining Patrons, we’ve begun receiving our first funds from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons&quot;&gt;Github Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;, which has totaled more than $8,000 to date, including mostly contributions from small sponsors. We’ve in turn been able to use those additional funds on a wider variety of projects. Simultaneously, we’ve also been revising our vision, strategy, marketing, and branding plan, to both set the future of Blockchain Commons and to explain its benefits to the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bold--excerpt--node&quot;&gt;Read More&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, this quarter we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;graduated five interns;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;beta-released our crypto libraries and our Seedtool;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;debuted the Spotbit price system, keytool, and URkit;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dramatically progressed our Gordian system of linked full node and wallet;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;and testified about legislation and regulations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s more information on some of our biggest successes this summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUMMER INTERNS. We had a great success with our first internship program, which is intended to not only support Blockchain Commons priorities but also to train the next generation of developers for the industry. This year, out of more than 30 applicants, we brought in eight, five of whom finished their entire internship. They are: Gautham Ganesh Elango from Australia, Gorazd Kovacic from Slovenia, Christian Murray of Dartmouth, Nishit Shah, and Javier Vargas. Not only did they support some of our other priorities this quarter, but we also did our best to teach them about blockchain and business alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We received some good publicity for our efforts, and plan to offer more internships in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SPOTBIT. One of our major intern team projects was the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spotbit.info&quot;&gt;Spotbit&lt;/a&gt;, now in late alpha and already in use by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GordianWallet.com&quot;&gt;Gordian Wallet&lt;/a&gt;. This is an anonymized price-data system that makes use of Tor, so that you can maintain the same level of privacy when accessing price data as you can when transacting Bitcoins. It is live at a &lt;a href=&quot;h6zwwkcivy2hjys6xpinlnz2f74dsmvltzsd4xb42vinhlcaoe7fdeqd.onion&quot;&gt;Tor .onion site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRYPTO LIBRARIES. We have moved many of our C-language cryptographic libraries to feature-complete beta status. This includes our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base&quot;&gt;bc-crypto-base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blockchainCommons/bc-shamir/&quot;&gt;bc-shamir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr&quot;&gt;bc-sskr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39&quot;&gt;bc-bip39&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur&quot;&gt;bc-ur&lt;/a&gt; libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEEDTOOL. We simultaneously upgraded our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blockchainCommons/seedtool-cli&quot;&gt;seedtool&lt;/a&gt; command-line tool to feature-complete beta status. This is the showcase for our crypto libraries, as well as a handy seed generation and conversion tool in its own right. Our move to beta status for seedtool was done after we replaced SLIP39 technology with our own SSKR technology, due to our discovery of a major flaw in SLIP39 that makes it incompatible with BIP39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KEYTOOL: We have released the first alpha of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blockchainCommons/keytool-cli&quot;&gt;keytool&lt;/a&gt; command-line tool, which offers all the various complex conversions of seeds (from seedtool) to derive master keys, descriptors, and public and private keys for use with cryptocurrencies and digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URKIT. We also created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URKit&quot;&gt;URKit&lt;/a&gt; as another working example of our bc-ur cryptolibrary, including additional functionality not found in Seedtool, such as animated QRs (see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-GGZ9FyuT8&quot;&gt;YouTube demo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-014-urs-on-epaper.md&quot;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt; on running URs on e-paper displays). This has led to one of our first community successes, as Foundation Devices has ported &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur&quot;&gt;bc-ur&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, which will enable them to support our emerging animated QR standard. URKit is also being integrated into the Gordian Wallet this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LETHEKIT. We are finalizing our second major release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://LetheKit.com&quot;&gt;LetheKit&lt;/a&gt; so that it supports all the same features as found in our feature-complete Seedtool. We expect to see that work done within the first few weeks of Q4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE GORDIAN SYSTEM. Our Tor-connected wallet and full node (formerly known as Fully Noded 2 and Bitcoin Standup for Mac) got a rename, but more notably we’ve been expanding the whole system. Our wallet is completing its integration with the newest QR and UR code found in our libraries, while Gordian Server now allows the option of installing Blockstream’s C-Lighting, and our Linux Bitcoin Standup scripts can install other optional bitcoin-related services, including C-Lightning, LND, BTCPay, Esplora and Spotbit. We have also created Catalyst frameworks for Tor and LibWally that allow for simultaneous development of Mac and iOS apps, so we now have a late alpha of the Gordian Wallet available for macOS based on our more mature Gordian Wallet for iOS codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WALLET STANDARDS: We’ve begun hosting a strong collaboration in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community&quot;&gt;Airgapped Wallet Community&lt;/a&gt;, to support finalizing the design of these next-generation wallet interoperability features and standards. Our QuickConnect to Tor feature has been adopted by full node vendors BTCPayServer, Nodl, MyNode, and RaspiBlitz. Our Account Map proposal has been adopted by Specter, BlueWallet, Magical Bitcoin Wallet. We have successfully managed multisig interoperability demos with other wallets, including Cold Card, Electrum, Cobovault, Foundation Devices. There’s much more to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEARNING BITCOIN FROM THE COMMAND LINE. Our popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line&quot;&gt;Learning Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; course saw a massive leap forward, with the whole course updated to Bitcoin 0.20.1 and new sections written on SegWit, Bech32, descriptors, PSBTs, BTCDeb, HWI, and Tor. We also closed out three updated chapters on coding in a variety of programming languages, including supporting Libwally with C. All that’s left before completing v2.0 of the course are two new chapters on Lightning, which have been drafted, but not fully edited. Many of these updates received support from our summer interns. We should be able to announce the completion of v2 of the course in just a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPEN DEVELOPMENT &amp;amp; PATENTS: In addition to offering all of our new code this quarter under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-Patent.html&quot;&gt;spdx:BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License&lt;/a&gt;, we have published examples of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blockchainCommons/open-development&quot;&gt;open development legal resources&lt;/a&gt;, including our contributor license and our open software developer, internship, and security services agreements. We have also joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://open-patent.org&quot;&gt;COPA&lt;/a&gt; (the Crypto Open Patent Alliance), as the best current solution to our long-standing commitment to a defensive patent strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEGISLATION &amp;amp; REGULATION: Blockchain Commons Founder Christopher Allen has spoken and given written testimony several times before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2020/S19&quot;&gt;Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology&lt;/a&gt;. This summer, he was appointed as a member of two sub-committees: Digital Identity, working on a legal definition for Digital Identity under self-sovereign principles; and DAOs, working on making new forms of blockchain-enabled corporations acceptable in Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support of the Blockchain Commons this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re determined to expand on these and other projects, to make Bitcoin and the blockchain easier to use for everyone. Thus, we’re already getting started on our Q4 work, which we hope to include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The move of the Gordian system beta to support Bitcoin mainnet (aka “real money”).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The publication of a GordianSigner app to the iPhone, Mac and Google Appstores, and (hopefully) the iOS Appstore approval of Gordian Wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The release of our first Android app, GordianSigner, allowing more parties to participate in multisig transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The publication of the second edition of our popular #SmartCustody Book, including reorganizing the text to make it more approachable, expanding our options to more kinds of hardware wallets, updating old scenarios, introducing new scenarios for multi-sigs, and covering the use of the well-reviewed Gnosis Ethereum smart contract.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The creation of signtool and verifytool apps to supplement keytool, leveraging the latest HD and Schnorr signature technologies and adding to our erector set of command-line app companions to seedtool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The continued discussion and deployment of new airgapped wallet standards such as animated QR-based PSBTs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A push forward on decentralized identity, beginning with the integration of PSBT &amp;amp; JSON-LD 1.1 signing into signtool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new externship program, where a company lends us an engineer to work on Blockchain Commons priorities and in turn learns about our work and the open-source community.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evangelization to developers about code and projects completed in Q3 such as Spotbit, Learning Bitcoin, seedtool, and LetheKit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other open infrastructure activities, such as new regional Tor exit node (our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/644074F47257F9A906F9AA5C6B8926C1540A1DA8&quot;&gt;Tor exit node&lt;/a&gt; is now over year old!), did:tor DID (W3C Decentralized Identifier) method, and other Tor-based human-rights privacy tools and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this all requires support, so we encourage you to spread the word, to use your business and community contacts to bring in other people as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons&quot;&gt;Patrons&lt;/a&gt; at any level. We know that we’re offering important work here, and we want to be able to continue that work for the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are announcing the availability of the open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-Bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin framework for iOS&lt;/a&gt;. We have been working with veteran iOS developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfmcnally.com/125/announcing-open-source-bitcoin-framework-for-ios/&quot;&gt;Wolf McNally&lt;/a&gt; on wallet apps for iOS that will support airgapped transaction signing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/&quot;&gt;BTCR Decentralized Identity (DID)&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this effort we chose to build on the open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://libbitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;libbitcoin&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-c-to-swift&quot;&gt;From C++ to Swift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libbitcoin is written in C++. This poses a problem for incorporating it into native iOS apps: there is no straightforward way to import C++ code into Swift. Swift does interface fairly easily to straight C, however. So to bridge the gap we wrote two frameworks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-CBitcoin&quot;&gt;CBitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, which exports a C-based interface from libbitcoin, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-Bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, which builds on CBitcoin to export a clean Swift interface to libbitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the purpose of these two frameworks is primarily to facilitate building cryptocurrency wallets on iOS, we haven’t (so far) had a need to export parts of libbitcoin that are useful primarily to Bitcoin nodes. Pull requests are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building libbitcoin for iOS is no simple task. It has two other dependencies: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1&quot;&gt;libsecp256k1&lt;/a&gt;,  which handles the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography&quot;&gt;elliptic curve cryptography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boost.org/&quot;&gt;libboost&lt;/a&gt;, which is a large toolkit for writing better C++. These and libbitcoin itself have to be built as fat binaries for two ARM architectures for running on the iPhone, native MacOS, and another version for running on MacOS under the iOS simulator. For this we built on the open source work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Airbitz&quot;&gt;Airbitz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the binaries are built, they have to be combined into fat binaries and then bundled into frameworks. We provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-CBitcoin/blob/master/build_frameworks.sh&quot;&gt;Bash shell script to coordinate these steps&lt;/a&gt;. The build takes over half an hour on a Mac Pro, so to save others the time my script zips up the resulting frameworks and checks them into GitHub too. &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, the zipped frameworks exceed GitHub’s file size limit, but it turns out they also have a solution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-lfs.github.com/&quot;&gt;Git Large File Storage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-now-with-cocoapods&quot;&gt;Use Now with Cocoapods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final frameworks are deployed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cocoapods.org/&quot;&gt;Cocoapods&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bitcoin framework is the only one you need to reference directly in your iOS app, by including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Bitcoin'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Podfile&lt;/code&gt;, and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in your &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.swift&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unit tests are in the Bitcoin framework &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/code&gt; target. All the detailed instructions are in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/iOS-Bitcoin&quot;&gt;Bitcoin framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;picture&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;email&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;nil}]}</name></author><category term="Projects" /><category term="Projects" /><category term="Bitcoin" /><category term="Distributed Identity" /><category term="BTCR" /><summary type="html">Building on Libbitcoin Today we are announcing the availability of the open source Bitcoin framework for iOS.
